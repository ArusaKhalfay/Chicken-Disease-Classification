# Chicken-Disease-Classification

This project aims to develop a deep learning system to differentiate between chicken fecal samples that show signs of Coccidiosis and those that appear healthy. The system will analyze and interpret images of fecal samples to accurately identify disease symptoms versus normal characteristics, enhancing early detection and management of poultry diseases.
